# Managing Packages With NPM

This repository contains my independent work for the first exercise in freeCodeCamp's [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) course. This section of the course was called "Managing Packages with NPM", and involved writing the package.json file for a project in a Gitpod environment and submitting its link to pass the required NPM challenges. My notes from completing the challenges for this are contained in [the pdf in this repository.](https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-Managing-Packages-with-NPM/blob/main/Managing%20Packages%20with%20NPM%20Course%20Notes.pdf)
