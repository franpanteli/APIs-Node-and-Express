# Managing Packages With NPM

This repository contains my independent work for the second exercise in freeCodeCamp's [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) course. This section of the course was called "Basic Node and Express", and involved writing the myApp.js file for a project in a Gitpod environment and submitting its link to pass 12 JavaScript challenges. The problem solving approaches I used when solving these challenges are outlined in depth in the project myApp.js file in this repository. My notes from completing these JavaScript challenges are contained in [the pdf in this repository.](https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-Node-and-Express/blob/main/Node%20and%20Express%20Course%20Notes.pdf)
