# APIs Node and Express
This repository contains my independent work for the second exercise in freeCodeCamp's [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) course. This section of the course was called "Basic Node and Express", where I solved 12 Javascript challenges by writing the myApp.js file for a project in a Gitpod environment. The problem-solving approach I used to solve these challenges is outlined in depth in [the project myApp.js file in this ](https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-Node-and-Express/blob/main/myApp.js). My notes on the material from this section of the course are contained in [the pdf in this repository.](https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-Node-and-Express/blob/main/Node%20and%20Express%20Course%20Notes.pdf) These notes are in-depth and cover the following topics with Node and Express:
<ul>
  <li>Meet the Node console</li>
  <li>Start a Working Express Server</li>
  <li>Serve an HTML File</li>
  <li>Serve Static Assets</li>
