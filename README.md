# Managing Packages With NPM

This repository contains my independent work for the second exercise in freeCodeCamp's [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) course. This section of the course was called "Basic Node and Express", and involved solving 12 JavasScipt challenges by writing the myApp.js file for a project in a Gitpod environment. The problem solving thought proccesses I used to solve these challenges are outlined in depth in the project myApp.js file in this repository. My notes from completing the material from this section of the course is contained in [the pdf in this repository.](https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-Node-and-Express/blob/main/Node%20and%20Express%20Course%20Notes.pdf)
